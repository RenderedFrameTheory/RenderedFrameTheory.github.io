# The Censorship Wall We Hit

Since launching RFT, we've faced unexplained bans, shadow removals, and algorithmic suppression on platforms like X, Reddit, and even scientific forums.

Despite publishing 50+ DOI-protected scientific documents, accurate BAO predictions (313.40 Mpc), and Earth-based render data, the system seems allergic to models that don't rely on dark matter or inflation.

RFT is not just a new theory — it exposes what conventional science *refuses* to render. And that's exactly why it keeps getting locked out.

But it won't stop us. The site you’re on right now exists for that reason alone.
