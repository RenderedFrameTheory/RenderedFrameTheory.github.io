# The Story Behind RFT

Rendered Frame Theory (RFT) was born from a single question: *What is the true speed of sight?* From that point forward, it evolved into a fully-fledged cosmological and quantum framework redefining space, time, and consciousness.

Created by Liam Grinstead, RFT was not built in an institution or under funding â€” it was built from scratch using open logic, observer-based reasoning, and testable mathematics. Every equation, prediction, and document has been released to the public, DOI-backed, and ready for replication.

This isn't just a theory. It's a rebellion against scientific gatekeeping. It's what happens when truth gets rendered instead of filtered.
