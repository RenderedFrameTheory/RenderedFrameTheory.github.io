# Feedback & Predictions

We invite all readers, researchers, skeptics, and simulation theorists to engage with RFT:

- Found an inconsistency?
- Have predictions to compare?
- Want to validate or challenge a result?

You can post your thoughts or requests on:
- [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/RenderedFrameTheory/RenderedFrameTheory/issues)
- Contact Liam directly: liamgrinstead2@gmail.com

Let’s keep it open. Let’s keep it real.

You may also replicate our prediction protocols from the [main site](https://renderedframetheory.github.io).
