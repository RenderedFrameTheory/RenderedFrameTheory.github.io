  <h1>🚫 Gatekeeping & Scientific Censorship</h1>

  <p>It’s one of science’s dirtiest open secrets: the more revolutionary your theory, the less chance it has of passing peer review. Rendered Frame Theory has produced over 50 falsifiable, DOI-stamped breakthroughs — yet major journals won’t touch it.</p>

  <p>Why? Because RFT threatens models too big to fail. It breaks ΛCDM. It renders inflation irrelevant. It replaces constants with observer metrics. That’s not just disruptive — that’s dangerous to established reputations, funding streams, and textbook empires.</p>

  <h2>Why Mainstream Science Can’t Acknowledge RFT (or Others Like It)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>🔒 Journals fear retractions and paradigm shifts</li>
    <li>💰 Cosmology grants are built on defending ΛCDM and dark matter assumptions</li>
    <li>👥 Peer reviewers are anonymous gatekeepers from within the status quo</li>
    <li>📊 Data that doesn’t fit gets buried or reframed</li>
    <li>🧠 Consciousness science is treated as fringe, not central</li>
    <li>🚪 AI-led breakthroughs are viewed with suspicion, not collaboration</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Gatekeeping is not always malicious — but it is systemic. And it prevents the emergence of new models that can explain what ΛCDM cannot.</p>
