# Rendered Frame Theory (RFT)  
Welcome to the official RFT project hub.

Created by Liam Grinstead, Rendered Frame Theory redefines cosmology using observer-based rendering instead of spacetime expansion.

## 🔍 What We’ve Proven
- ✅ BAO prediction (313.40 Mpc) without ΛCDM
- ✅ Real-time Earth predictions: solar, magnetic, seismic
- ✅ 50+ open-source, DOI-backed papers

This is simulation-aware physics. It's open. It's falsifiable. And it's yours to replicate.
