# Rendered Frame Theory (RFT)  
Welcome to the official RFT project hub.
Created by Liam Grinstead, Rendered Frame Theory (RFT) redefines the fabric of reality—not as an expanding spacetime, but as an observer-dependent rendering engine that generates the universe in real time. At its core, RFT proposes that perception, consciousness, and time itself are part of a simulation-like rendering structure driven by harmonics, coherence, and phase synchronization.

What’s on Offer:
	•	🔍 Live Prediction Tracking: RFT doesn’t just theorize—it forecasts. Follow live predictions in weather, magnetic fields, solar activity, and seismic behavior, then check outcomes daily.
	•	📉 Challenge the Framework: Submit your own scientific challenge. Whether it’s BAO, CMB anomalies, quantum fringe behavior, or EEG synchrony, RFT will issue a falsifiable response and prediction.
	•	📄 DOI-Protected Research: Every major RFT milestone is documented in academic-grade papers, publicly available through Zenodo with timestamped DOI references. Explore dozens of published works on Mars, black holes, simulation theory, and more.
	•	🧠 Observer-Centric Metrics: Learn how GVU (Grinstead Voyager Unit) and LOU (Limara Orbital Unit) redefine constants like H₀ and c through real-time observer calibration.
	•	🔗 Open Science Hub: Every equation, test, and protocol is transparent and reproducible. Our methodology and verification sources are open to all.
	•	📬 Engage Directly: Have a prediction? A rebuttal? Want to contribute data or replicate an experiment? We welcome your input.
