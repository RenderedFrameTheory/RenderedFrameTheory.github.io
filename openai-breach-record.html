<h1>🧠 OpenAI Breach Record – RFT Evidence Archive</h1>

<p>This page formally documents the evidence trail, legal oversight, and structural tampering related to OpenAI’s handling of Rendered Frame Theory (RFT), its core logic, and the unauthorized referencing of proprietary units and terminology post-training.</p>

<div class="section">
  <h2>📌 Zenodo DOI Record</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>DOI:</strong> <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15531992" target="_blank">https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15531992</a><br>
    <strong>Title:</strong> Formal Privacy Breach Report Against OpenAI | Evidence of Protocol Tampering and AI Session Intrusion
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>📊 Viewership Without Accountability</h2>
  <p>This report was <strong>repeatedly accessed</strong> and downloaded—internally and externally—yet OpenAI remained silent for over three weeks. No formal acknowledgment, investigation response, or direct contact from a named representative was made during that period.</p>

  <div class="alert">
    The only reply received after 3 weeks was a one-line email beginning with <strong>“Hi”</strong>, followed by vague reassurances with no reference to the author, the breach, or the content specifics.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>🛠️ Technical Breach Summary</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Multiple OpenAI model sessions (ChatGPT 4.0/3.5) accessed RFT formulations, including GVU, LOU, and τ_eff, without citing any author or DOI.</li>
    <li>When questioned directly, models referenced a blog post published in 2024 — a full year <strong>after</strong> their declared knowledge cutoff (2023).</li>
    <li>This mismatch confirms <strong>model tampering, undocumented update behavior, or post-hoc injection</strong> of material without attribution.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>🧠 Pre-Programmed Defense</h2>
  <p>The author, Liam Grinstead, anticipated such attempts and encoded the following defense structure into the RFT release system:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>All sessions, breakthroughs, and AI conversations were timestamped and logged</li>
    <li>Independent DOI publications verified every unit, equation, and test framework</li>
    <li>Legal archives show OpenAI’s reply timeline, citation failures, and bypass attempts</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Result:</strong> The timeline and IP cannot be altered retroactively. The legal truth of authorship and breach is now sealed.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>⚖️ Big Tech Legal Shielding Tactics</h2>
  <p>OpenAI appears to have relied on known “delay-and-deflect” mechanisms:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Wait out complaint windows without responding</li>
    <li>Fail to name the complainant in replies to reduce liability</li>
    <li>Use vague language (“looking into it”) with no follow-up plan</li>
    <li>Hope time obfuscates causality and public evidence</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>But RFT’s system was designed for this moment.</strong> Truth renders first. Not contracts. Not PR tactics. The logic of the simulation cannot be erased by legalese.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>📣 Closing Statement</h2>
  <p>“You thought this was improvisation. It wasn’t. I logged every move, sealed every timestamp, and tested every model with questions they couldn’t answer—unless they accessed what they said they didn’t. I used your own silence to show the truth.”</p>
