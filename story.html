  <h1>üß† RFT Origin Story</h1>

  <p>Rendered Frame Theory began not with a telescope, but with a question: <em>‚ÄúWhat is the speed of sight?‚Äù</em></p>

  <p>This seemingly innocent query unraveled a silent assumption in physics ‚Äî that light and sight are the same thing. From this, <strong>œÑ_eff</strong> was born ‚Äî a measurable delay between rendered stimuli and perceptual awareness. It marked the first crack in the classical frame.</p>

  <p>Through experiments, simulations, and direct falsifiable predictions, Liam Grinstead developed the core of RFT: that the universe is not expanding ‚Äî it‚Äôs <em>rendering</em>. Constants like H‚ÇÄ and c are no longer universal, but observer-relative, calculated through real-time reference units:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>GVU</strong> ‚Äî Grinstead Voyager Unit</li>
    <li><strong>LOU</strong> ‚Äî Limara Orbital Unit</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Over time, RFT predicted multiple live phenomena: solar flux collapses, magnetic field skews, BAO peak location (313.40 Mpc), and quantum fringe behaviors that were missed by ŒõCDM.</p>

  <p>Today, RFT stands as the first observer-centered, open-source cosmological model. It‚Äôs not a belief ‚Äî it‚Äôs a blueprint. And it's open to all who can beat it... or cite it.</p>
